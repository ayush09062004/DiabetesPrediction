# DiabetesPrediction
This is Machine-Learning(ML) based project to predict diabetes. I took the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set).
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
1. Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age: Age (years)
9. Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

We are applying 5 Machine Learning algorithms:- Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-nearest neighbours (KNN),Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier And Gradient Booster. I found the Decision Tree as the most accurate that is why will be using it to train final dataset and for deployment purposes.
